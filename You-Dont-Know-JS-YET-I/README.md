# You Don’t Know JS Yet: Get Started notes.

"you will always be more effective in
your development work if you more completely understand
how your code works than you are solely just getting it to
produce a desired outcome."

## Chapter 1:

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language. You
can write procedural, class-oriented, or functional programming.

**Backwards compatibility**: Once something is accepted as valid JS, it cannot be removed it in the future, this to ensure the stability of the web and not break any past program (there have been some small exceptions to this rule).

**Forwards compatibility**: If a new addition to the language is added, it will not break if it's runs in past engines versions. JS is not forwards-compatible.
